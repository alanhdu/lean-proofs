# Lean Theorems

I've decided to pick up [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/), a theorem
prover from Microsoft research after watching [Kevin Buzzard](
https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/)'s evangelism. This was a fortuitous
time for me -- I had been planning to brush up on my real analysis and
measure theory (which I have honestly mostly forgotten) and I had always
wanted to learn how to use a theorem prover (although I was originally
planning on picking up either Coq or Isabelle). Thanks to Buzzard, it looks
like formalizing real analysis using Lean is the way to go.

This is going to be my repository of various mathematicla proofs that I do
along the way. Originally, I plan to mostly follow Terry Tao's *Analysis*
textbook, but it may grow to include other branches of math.
